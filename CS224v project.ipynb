Okay so Company Q actually was a startup company like 10 years ago. I had been in contact and we have been exploring this technology actually since 2012 13 when I was working at Company E as well and. We since then actually you know we have been kind of like recommending this solution also to our clients to address the risk mitigation aspects of the electrical switchgear and electrical transformer and power distribution system. The technology is based on basically aside for technology that's where the saw comes from which is basically a surface acoustic wave technology. And it is a sensor based technology actually that basically provides the temperature measurement, humidity measurement as well as the partial discharge. So let's get into it says we are low actually that electrical race from switchgear perspective, otherwise, whether it is a loose connection that results into basically temperatures shoot up in the electrical bus bar connections things of that nature and and and sometimes you know it just creates an arc flash situation, and this is what the picture actually kind of that fix that so what we are trying to basically address here is a risk mitigation, you know generally the industry best best practice. I'm going to switch the slide here. These are some of the applications actually that this particular technology and the devices, actually, that is being that will up by Company Q as being used which is self explanatory I don't know to speak to it. The traditional method in terms of you know, monitoring the temperature actually in the switch gear bus more and things like that is basically on a very periodic basis, once a year twice a year, or something of that nature, depending on actually the organization, the company. And it was basically it is that technology, this is basically just a temperature thermal scanning actually with the temperature gun. And it is a snapshot in time, so this many actually, I have taken this temperature, you know it is within the range. And no issues I walk away from it next minute God knows what happens so what is the temperature so this is where actually this cutting edge technology actually comes into play where it will monitor the temperature, humidity, and partial discharged on a real time basis, it will provide the data information actually on the fly. So that is what we are presenting today and know as the sensors are powered by you know RF signals to monitor monitoring unit and antennas. So these are basically the sensors and other devices actually that makes it the total system for temperature monitoring partial discharge as well as the humidity temperature sensors are you.\\nExample Output: Alright, so let me go into presentation mode here, guys, see if it works. <Commissive> Okay so Company Q actually was a startup company like 10 years ago.

Software A to CMMS Integration: The integration effort of Software A with the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) was discussed, including the need for testing on the development system, setting up parameters, deciding where to start, and the implications on Company P's maintenance process.\n","\n","2. Condition-Based vs. Schedule-Based Maintenance: A deeper conversation took place concerning the shift from schedule-based to condition-based maintenance supported by CMMS, the changes it might introduce to Company P's operations, vendor relations, logistics, budget, and the need for new procedures.\n","\n","3. Pilot Testing and Machine Learning: The potential for using machine learning to monitor equipment health was considered along with setting up a pilot test to compare Company Z's technology with existing systems.\n","\n","4. Software A Analytics and Energy Consumption Models: There was a detailed technical exchange regarding the proper calculation of energy consumption models in Software A and how to correctly integrate real-world operational hours into the models.\n","\n","5. Corporate Strategies and Approaches: The strategic decisions behind sharing operational data with a larger database for machine learning purposes were discussed, weighing the costs and benefits, as well as the company-wide implications.\n","\n","What speakers committed to doing after the meeting:\n","\n","1. A1 will start testing the Software A to CMMS integration on the development system next week, and define where to place certain parameters like meters.\n","\n","2. L0 will be away for two weeks but will pick up the discussion afterward to define the goals of the CMMS and Software A tests, and liaise with the maintenance department.\n","\n","3. A0 will look into Life safety sensors and their integration, figuring out if faults can generate work orders directly.\n","\n","4. A1 and A0 committed to comparing the Company Z and Company R systems to validate Company Z's capabilities and cost-effectiveness.\n","\n","5. A1 will meet with V6 to discuss access to CMMS and start conversations relevant to Software C.\n","\n","6. L0 will organize a follow-up meeting regarding Company Z, focussing on the machine learning aspect and seeking answers to questions raised during the meeting.\n","\n","7. A0 and A1 agreed to pursue the pilot with the new sensors from Company Z, considering the cost implications and installation details.\n","\n","8. A0 and A1 will reconfigure energy consumption models within Software A to accurately represent the actual operating hours.\n","\n","9. A1 will assist A0 with a data transfer to a new solid-state drive for their systems.\n","\n","Action items that need to be done:\n","\n","1. **Testing Software A and CMMS Integration**: Ensure Software A works effectively within the development environment and then move onto the production system.\n","\n","2. **Define Parameters for CMMS**: Decide which metrics to track (e.g. approach temperature, differential pressure or dp, freezer monitoring) and how that integrates with generating work orders or service requests in CMMS.\n","\n","3. **Select Pilot Area for Machine Learning**: Choose a particular process or piece of equipment where Company Z's machine learning can be piloted and data comparison can be made between Company Z and Company R's systems.\n","\n","4. **Follow Up on Machine Learning and Service Capabilities**: Set up further discussions with Company Z regarding the machine learning aspect of their system, including installation concerns and potential comparison with Company R's offerings.\n","\n","5. **Recalculate Energy Consumption Models in Software A**: A0 and A1 need to adjust the formulas to account for the actual hours of equipment operation.\n","\n","6. **Installation and Setup for Pilot Sensors**: A0 and A1 need to ensure proper installation of Company Z sensors, possibly with the help of partners, and configure the gateway to integrate with Software A.\n","\n","7. **Documentation and Work Instructions**: A1 suggested creating documentation on how to restore the software images on new hard drives as the issue arises frequently.\n","\n","8. **Prepare for Next Meeting**: Coordination of the next meeting to discuss progress, including updated data presentations on Software A and further averaging out existing questions with Company Z.\n","\n","Conversation breakdowns:\n","\n","1. **Miscommunication on Maintenance Protocols**: There was a point of confusion regarding Company P's comfort level with changing from schedule-based maintenance to condition-based maintenance.

Well, we actually asked them not to replace the filters, so but i'm thinking we could set up a hybrid where we monitor the dp and we generate a service request if it's too high, but then we also have a scheduled maintenance and maybe we could just increase the schedule the time between replacing the filters if we have both maybe.

So hmm yeah yeah um let's let's the three of us discuss what's the most, the least impact, you know to uh CMMS and still get what we need to do with the, with this integration. Want to make sure all the linkage works, we want to share that all the right data get to CMMS, but what is the right data? And how do you want to use that data? We need a, we need sort of to kind of propose something to um Maintenance department and see what kind of impact it has on their current operation so. yeah so you know i'm going to be gone for the next two weeks, but I, when I come back you know i'll pick up this discussion, you know hmm just just kind of identify what do we want to get out of these test, you know and um and then have a conversation with maintenance folks.\n","A1, A0, L0, A1, A0: and they look for anomalies The equipment wise they do do some kind of PMs but you're talking about maybe the process utility right? They’re they probably don't do much maintenance. yeah yeah no um so yeah I want to use this meeting to kind of talk about you know Company Z. Um A0 and I had a post discussion after our meeting on Wednesday with their presentation. Uh I think A0, I both agree that we should set up a pilot and and do a parallel comparison for the building Omega equipment that's already on wireless on the Company R system. And put Company Z system on it, you know just to kind of compare. Have all the data go thru the Software A, you know and then we'll look at it ourselves, you know so. yeah and it’s. I think it's also important to compare yeah\n","A0, A1, A0, A1, A0: yeah apples and apples. Because Company Z's solution is cheaper than the route based solution we have today. That return of investment would be less than six months. So yeah I can, if it's asked, I think it's a good .. if it if it's as, almost as good as if it's as good as the wireless Company R solution. yeah it's definitely a win right, because it's 5% the cost each sensor um Yea we, we also need to find out how- who’s going to be able to install it right? And make sure that it's installed properly. yeah I think we should probably reach out to.. they said they had partners that could also help us look at the data and install them and. yeah yeah so that that that was in the meeting minutes uh that they sent out yesterday, right? so they need to get back to us on those answer. I know the system, the the instruments are cheap.

Is it the dp? is it, is it the Software C freezer monitoring, where do we want to start? Or do we just want to start with one thing to check it out? yeah um so this this Software A CMMS integration, we want to use the CMMS to generate the work order right? yeah. So… So. yeah go ahead\n","A0, A1: How about the installation and who is going to look at the data, interpret the data for us Well interpret the data that's machine learning. That’s why- where it's different than Company R right?wrong and kind of warn you  Company R they one is- even though it's wireless you still have to manually look at the data. Here they will, machine learning will put- it will see when something's  Yeah well without without looking at it does it come with recommendation on what did you or..? I don't know. That’s a good question. yeah because that would- you know with Company R right we create analytics we know oh ok this is a bearing failure [screen share of email from Company Z to Company A team summarizing the questions from the meeting]. This is a lubrication issues.\n","A0, L0, A1: yeah behind the scene right? So And it should be specific to Software B right? I think they have.. mmhmm the other metrics.

They said something about a pack of five sensors right? Okay And you, you can actually. Um. I don't know, let me just share my screen. Okay. [silence, while scrolling screen] And the integration of the gateway to Software A is all wireless right? so it just IP address and you link up Uhh. So the- yeah basically you take your phone and you say this sensor should go to this gateway Ah\n","A1, L0, A0: We have human learning And… yeah human learning and will machine learning be as good. yeah so But the, the wireless one it once it's set up we don't have to tweak anything it's just it’s yeah yep\n","A1, L0: you want to quickly show uh, show me what they look like? Oh, by the way this is, [still sharing screen and scrolling down Company Z Software B page with images of a phone app that includes failure mode, failure cause, action taken fill-ins] kind of with the machine learning right it- what we talked about failure mode, so you if there's an error exists that it doesn't know you kind of gave it the reason and it learns from that. So this learning from data. Looks like. Anyways let me stop sharing. [screen share ends] So how is failure mode defined in their data? [silence] Failure mode? Yea, failure mode, you know, .. root cause. Oh, I think that's the- you put in if if something happens and it doesn't know what it asks you what it is, and then you tell it and then it's kind of collective intelligence right? all the people in the world with fans they tell it what it is, and then it learns what it is, so the longer, and the more people who use it, the smarter it gets. yeah and you know does Company Z have that database? You know does our failure [someone shares screen of Software A] mode get shared with the rest of the world? you know um because you know just those kind of questions. I don’t know. Um yea. If it's used to train the model it's not really being shared with anyone right? It’s just, it just gets smarter. yeah. Then then from those uh, from those data somebody still has to go look at it say that's mostly caused by bearing, that's mostly caused by lubricant. you know uh. So how do we, how do we get that information into the machine learning right?\n","A1, L0: so yeah i'm really curious about how Company Z approach these you know. yeah um me too. I think it is because it's it's when it's neural networks, I think I read somewhere, they need millions of samples before they get accurate right? and no company in the world can can have 1 million faulty bearings. So you really need a big company like Company Z to kind of gather this data for thousands of, from thousands of sites, to train this model. So it's definitely interesting to see how well it works. yeah you know if Company Z can do that they're hitting a you know, a big black hole in the industry that everybody wanted, you know, because really helped the industry right? But I don't know how successful they are in terms of you know, initiating these and be able to you know sort out the data, analyze the data, and share the results with you know not just people that sign up for Software B right?\n","A0, UK, L0: [silence] I think the office, they do shut shut it down. In Alpha? Uhh  I don't think\n","A0, L0, A1: Because ah let me show you the analysis. [clicks to change screens] Oh, is average. But it’s average of this many fans here [uses mouse to point at the list of fans]. [silence] Uh the run oh. Oh is this the runtime that is the average? Because I don't want, I don't want to total them right? because we are looking at the, a fan wall as a whole right? yeah we don't have each fan right? But if you take the combined power, .. average power consumption, then you should just multiply, not the.. Well. Well we don't want to take the average. You so you have to on the, on the return fan wall, you have the sum of power consumption right? that's yeah\n","A1, A0: And you drove, you drive 12 hours. Then you have driven 1200 miles right? if you take your average speed over 24 hours, it would be 50 miles per hour. So you don't want to multiply that by the hours you have been running that would give you a wrong number. You want to multiply it by the hours you just average, which is the 24 hours and not the 12 hours. hmm Does that make sense? Your average kilowatt shows you how much in average per hour. mhmm So you need just to multiply by just a hard coded number, which is the number of hours in two weeks.\n","A1, A0: So it’s, it's 336 for two weeks. [silence, A0 clicks on formula] So this should be hard coded number? yeah [silence]\n","A0, A1: So that's the same for for this [clicks to change screen to formulas for other AHU] too right? Yes, yes should be. And the water as well then [clicks change screen to water assets in Software A] hmm [silence]\n","A0, L0, A1: yeah. [silence] Okay. Same with the uhhh cooling tower fans [clicks to change screen to those formulas] [silence] Yes.\n","A0, A1: yeah so we would get a trend, where each point would be. Two weeks is how many hours again? 200 something right you said? Three hundred and thirty-six [silence]\n","A0, L0: yeah so um. 1.8 But, but right now, right now, both sensors are showing wrong right? we still need to go change out the filter so that they can install it properly so. Anyway, i'll work with M0 on that see how we can, we might be able to get a better dp reading.\n","A0, L0: the alarm limit as 1.8. yeah and is there another level? Or is it just 1.8? Just 1.8, you know, for now, right?

Software A to CMMS Integration: The meeting addressed the progress of integrating Software A with the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) and deliberated over whether to start with work orders or service requests. The goal is to determine how condition-based maintenance will impact current maintenance processes.\n","\n","2. Software C & Life Safety Sensors: Participants also discussed exploring Software C and handling potential fault alerts that could automatically generate work orders.\n","\n","3. Company Z Pilot for Smart Monitoring: The team debated setting up a pilot project with Company Z to compare its machine learning capability with the existing wireless system from Company R. Metrics like bearing failure, lubrication issues, and other performance indicators would be compared to check the reliability and cost-effectiveness of Company Z’s technology.\n","\n","4. Data Interpretation & Machine Learning: Concerns were raised about how data would be interpreted by the new system, whether machine learning could provide maintenance recommendations on its own, and how the system could learn from collected data.\n","\n","5. Cost Calculation Formulas in Software A: Attendees also discussed specific formulas within Software A for calculating metrics such as energy costs and power consumption for different systems, including fans and cooling towers.\n","\n","6. Sensor Placement and Reading Issues: There was a conversation about the placement of sensors in air handling units and how combined readings could be utilized for filter maintenance.\n","\n","Speakers committed to doing after the meeting:\n","1. A1 will test the Software A to CMMS integration on the development system and continue discussing with V5 and V6 about Software C.\n","2. L0 will handle discussions about how the new CBM process could potentially impact Company P's operations post-vacation.\n","3. A0 will reach out to V7 from Company Z for a local partner for sensor installation, and explore how life safety sensors can generate automated work orders.\n","4. L0 plans to set up a follow-up discussion with Company Z about their machine learning process.\n","5. A1 is supposed to collaborate with A0 to address sensor location issues based on insights from M3, especially related to AHUs 7 and 8.\n","\n","Action items that need to be done:\n","1. Define the scope and metrics for the Software A to CMMS integration pilot.\n","   - Explanation: Determine what specific data and which systems will be used to test the integration, like the dp (differential pressure), approach temperature, or Software C freezer monitoring.\n","   \n","2. Determine whether to use work orders or service requests in CMMS.\n","   - Explanation: Decide on the process by which maintenance tasks are initiated in the CMMS—either directly as work orders or first as service requests that require verification.\n","   \n","3. Initiate discussions with Company P on condition-based maintenance impacts.\n","   - Explanation: Have conversations to understand how transitioning from scheduled to condition-based maintenance tasks could affect Company P's operations and budget.\n","\n","4. Establish the details and funding for the Company Z pilot.\n","   - Explanation: Iron out how the pilot project will be organized, funded ($715 for five sensors and one wireless gateway), and who will perform installations. Determine what comparisons will be made between Company Z and Company R systems.\n","\n","5. Explore life safety sensor integration into CMMS.\n","   - Explanation: Investigate how life safety systems like HMS can be used to automatically generate work orders in case of a fault and whether facility operations would be more adaptable to this integration.\n","\n","6. Review and update cost calculation formulas in Software A.\n","   - Explanation: Adjust existing formulas for accurate power consumption and cost calculations to reflect bi-weekly runtime averages rather than total or average run hours.\n","\n","7. Address sensor location and reading issues in AHUs 7 and 8.\n","   - Explanation: As there's not enough space to measure pre and final filter dp separately, consider a composite reading strategy and first change the pre-filter when high dp is detected.\n","\n","Conversation breakdowns:\n","1. Uncertainty about the data interpretation and machine learning.\n","   - There was confusion regarding whether Company Z's machine learning system could independently provide maintenance recommendations without human intervention. The breakdown came from a lack of clarity on how the models are trained, how failure modes are defined, and whether collective intelligence from users across the globe would be used to enhance the algorithm. This led to the need to set up further meetings with Company Z to better understand their machine learning process and how other companies' data contribute to improving the system’s accuracy.\n","\n","2. Difficulty in calculating and agreeing on the correct formulas for power and cost calculations in Software A.\n","   - The breakdown occurred while trying to agree on the appropriate methodology for applying formulas to calculate energy costs associated with various assets. There was confusion over whether to multiply average kilowatt-hours by the run hours or the total hours in a period. It was resolved by explaining how averaging works across active and inactive periods, leading to an agreement on a \"hard-coded\" number of hours (336 hours for two weeks) needed to be used in the formulas. This detailed explanation helped clarify that one must account for the total time frame rather than just active run hours.\n","\n","3. Concern over sensor installation and maintenance strategy adaptation.\n","   - Questions about the installation and interpretation of data from newly introduced smart monitoring sensors also posed a problem. Company Ps' flexibility and willingness to adapt to Machine Learning powered sensors by Company Z remained uncertain. Detailed discussions indicated that there must be a cautious approach to change management regarding current maintenance processes alongside testing new technologies’ capabilities and integration.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install python-docx"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2QL-PBtZcNGx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701569948106,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":6591,"user":{"displayName":"Justin Lim","userId":"01943783631724600416"}},"outputId":"0484239e-7f84-4cf4-c9fa-8be55e330edd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting python-docx\n","  Downloading python_docx-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl (239 kB)\n","\u001b[?25l     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/239.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[91m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[90m╺\u001b[0m\u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m133.1/239.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m4.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m239.6/239.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: lxml>=3.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from python-docx) (4.9.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from python-docx) (4.5.0)\n","Installing collected packages: python-docx\n","Successfully installed python-docx-1.1.0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["assistant_reply = assistant_reply.replace('*', '').replace('#', '')\n","print(assistant_reply)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JuV-hMrThtLF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701076205350,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":226,"user":{"displayName":"Justin Lim","userId":"01943783631724600416"}},"outputId":"663bb924-6aab-4c98-8b59-ce23f1665a40"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["What the meeting was about:\n","The meeting was focused on several interrelated topics involving software integration, sensor installation, machine learning analytics, and maintenance processes:\n","\n","1.
