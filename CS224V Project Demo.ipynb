So L0 uh there’s one thing I think we should go over in this meeting.\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): So the Software A to CMMS integration, all the file, all the stuff that takes time basically has been approved and hopefully it will be done this week.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Oh\n","A1 (Commissive, Negotiate, Process, 0): So I will, I will start testing on the development system next week\n","A1 (Assertive, Predict, Process, 0): and then, we should be able to get it onto the production system, I think, within um one or two months.\n","A1 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): But the open question is, we need to define some meters somewhere so. kind of need to agree on where we're putting that.\n","A1 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Product, 1): Is this the approach temperature? Is it the dp? is it, is it the Software C freezer monitoring,\n","A1 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): where do we want to start? Or do we just want to start with one thing to check it out?\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): yeah um so this this Software A CMMS integration, we want to use the CMMS to generate the work order right?\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): yeah. So…\n","L0 (Directive, NA, NA, 0): So. yeah go ahead\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): So the way it works is, we will, Software A will not generate work orders. Software A will send me the data to CMMS and then in CMMS you can define when the dp is more than two for X amount of time generate a work order or service request, one of the two.\n","A1 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): So I guess that's also open question, do we want to generate work orders or service requests?\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): where a service request is a request that comes in, that needs to be verified by a person before it becomes a work order. We have the option to generate both basically.\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): Yeah that that is almost a separate discussion on how do we want to execute, you know condition based maintenance.\n","L0 (Directive, Explain, Process, 0): Because currently, all their maintenance is on schedule based right?\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Hmm\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): and then CMMS will kick out say now three months is up you got to go change filters.\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Organization, 0): And I think Company P is very comfortable uh with that you know process.\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): If we start you know telling them don't do anything and wait for the CMMS to tell you. That basically changes the current you know, maintenance process,\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): hmmm\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): and you know impacts the budget, impacts the logistics, impacts their vendor relationship uh and impacts, you know where do we want to do just in time delivery on you know parts that we need to you know do maintenance of.\n","L0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): So that that discussion needs to happen, you know, with people like V5, uh M0 and V5 uh um I forgot his last name, yeah. Um.\n","L0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): You know I don't know you know if if, at this time we just want to do pilot test,\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): okay\n","L0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): and then you know give out warning, but not actually generate any kind of request or work order so that they get used to the integration between Software A and CMMS.\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): And if we want to cut in a new maintenance process that needs to be you know new procedure needs to be written up, you know all the implication needs to be uh addressed, because Company P is saying that if you do that to me with you know, changing the current process, the costs might go up, might go down, you know. They got to work out all that during internal you know interaction between you know the procurement department, the technician out here and the the manpower resource, you know. I had a, I had a discussion with M3 and he really you know, open up my eyes, on the current maintenance protocol.\n","L0 (Commissive, Explain, Organization, 0): So um i’m definitely gonna be very mindful of the impact of what CBM is gonna do to the current process.\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): Okay.\n","A1 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): I guess we can.. Just to get.. We need something to get started, maybe we can\n","UK (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Yeah\n","A1 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): we can do a hybrid where we will keep.. Well, we actually asked them not to replace the filters, so but i'm thinking we could set up a hybrid where we monitor the dp and we generate a service request if it's too high, but then we also have a scheduled maintenance and maybe we could just increase the schedule the time between replacing the filters if we have both maybe. But … We need to test this CMMS integration with something. Yes, sir. A1.\n","UK (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): Yes\n","UK (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): Yes\n","A0 (Directive, Negotiate, Organization, 0): So A1 I think another parallel effort you can do is uh talk to also V5, V6 on the Software C stuff.\n","A1 (Commissive, Negotiate, Organization, 0): Oh yeah\n","A1 (Directive, Describe, Organization, 0): does he have access to CMMS.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): Yes, oh yeah yeah he's on site.\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): Okay, because then I’m, I’m meeting with him later today actually.\n","A0 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): Okay just have, start a, yeah discussion with him.\n","A1 (Commissive, Negotiate, Process, 0): Okay. okay. good idea.\n","NA (NA, NA, NA, 0): [silence]\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): He knows Software C too.\n","NA (NA, NA, NA, 0): [silence]\n","L0 (NA, NA, NA, 0): looks like just the three of …  \n","A0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): Have something to be able to qualify you know this application right? So hmm\n","UK (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): yeah\n","L0 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): yeah um let's let's the three of us discuss what's the most, the least impact, you know to uh CMMS and still get what we need to do with the, with this integration. Want to make sure all the linkage works, we want to share that all the right data get to CMMS, but what is the right data? And how do you want to use that data? We need a, we need sort of to kind of propose something to um Maintenance department and see what kind of impact it has on their current operation so.\n","L0 (Assertive, Negotiate, Organization, 0): yeah so you know i'm going to be gone for the next two weeks,\n","L0 (Commissive, Negotiate, Organization, 0): but I, when I come back you know i'll pick up this discussion, you know\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): hmm\n","L0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): just just kind of identify what do we want to get out of these test, you know and um and then have a conversation with maintenance folks.\n","A0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): Another thing that we can look into is the Life safety sensors right? The HMS instance if there's a fault that can automatically generate work order too right?\n","A1 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): yeah yeah we can do that\n","A1 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Product, 0): yeah if the vitality level right if it's too low.\n","A0 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Product, 0): Right yeah something like that \n","A1 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Product, 0): yeah or just the IO [faults] as well,\n","A0 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Product, 0): yea\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): but we have to be careful, if the whole PLC goes down then we’ll…\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Yea yea yea no no no IO fault, like vitality like you said yea\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Yea, okay\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Organization, 0): So, so that part of it does not impact maintenance right? That's strictly user equipment?\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): Yeah\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): yeah\n","A0 (Directive, Describe, Organization, 0): Uh it's. It goes. it's. Those systems are maintained by opera-, by facility operations right?\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Organization, 0): Oh really?\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Organization, 0): okay.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): yeah but it's not Company Ps so.\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): Oh, I see our internal folks maintain it, not Company Ps.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): yeah like Company L, Company S\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Organization, 0): OK OK OK.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): So they might be more flexible there I don't know.\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): yeah, I think so, I think so.\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Organization, 0): Sounds like Company Ps is not very …\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): But I also heard that uh, you know from C0 that a lot of the process equipment, we run it to failure, you know. We don't do any maintenance on it until the system fail like maybe uh TCUs, autoclaves or whatever. I don't know.\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): think so.\n","A1 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Product, 0): Yeah. That would be a good use case for the.. segue for the meeting we had with Company Z the um.\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): So we have Software B and we had the other one where you just sent them data\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): yea\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): and they look for anomalies\n","A0 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): The equipment wise they do do some kind of PMs but you're talking about maybe the process utility right?\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): They’re they probably don't do much maintenance.\n","L0 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): yeah yeah no um so yeah I want to use this meeting to kind of talk about you know Company Z.\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): Um A0 and I had a post discussion after our meeting on Wednesday with their presentation. Uh I think A0, I both agree that we should set up a pilot and and do a parallel comparison for the building Omega equipment that's already on wireless on the Company R system. And put Company Z system on it, you know just to kind of compare. Have all the data go thru the Software A, you know and then we'll look at it ourselves, you know so.\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): yeah and it’s. I think it's also important to compare\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Product, 0): apples and apples. Because Company Z's solution is cheaper than the route based solution we have today. That return of investment would be less than six months. So yeah I can, if it's asked, I think it's a good .. if it if it's as, almost as good as if it's as good as the wireless Company R solution. yeah it's definitely a win right, because it's 5% the cost each sensor um\n","A0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): Yea we, we also need to find out how- who’s going to be able to install it right? And make sure that it's installed properly.\n","A1 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): yeah I think we should probably reach out to.. they said they had partners that could also help us look at the data and install them and.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): yeah yeah so that that that was in the meeting minutes uh that they sent out yesterday, right?\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): so they need to get back to us on those answer.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): I know the system, the the instruments are cheap.\n","A0 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): How about the installation and who is going to look at the data, interpret the data for us\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): Well interpret the data that's machine learning.\n","A1 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): That’s why- where it's different than Company R right?wrong and kind of warn you\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0):  Company R they one is- even though it's wireless you still have to manually look at the data. Here they will, machine learning will put- it will see when something's \n","A0 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): Yeah well without without looking at it does it come with recommendation on what did you or..?\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): I don't know. That’s a good question.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): yeah because that would- you know with Company R right we create analytics we know oh ok this is a bearing failure [screen share of email from Company Z to Company A team summarizing the questions from the meeting]. This is a lubrication issues.\n","A0 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): Things like that right? so\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): yeah\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): So Company K is very proactive. They uh, you know they actually more concerned than us, um when things are not working well they're constantly reminding, “hey somebody should be looking at this,”\n","A0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Organization, 0): right? It’s basically Company R has been providing pretty good service, so we need to see if Company Z, their partners is also doing the same for us.\n","A0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): Um so that should be part of the comparison too,\n","UK (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): absolutel-\n","A0 (NA, NA, Process, 0): the services\n","L0 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): So do you want to have a follow up meeting? Just talk about machine learning or what is the [angle] that they\n","A0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): yeah we should we should get an answer for all this, uh like who is going to install it and yeah what, what are the additional warning capabilities right?\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): yeah\n","A0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): Would they be able to tell us what's wrong with it?\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n","L0 (Directive, Explain, Process, 0): I’m just thinking you know I think their machine learning is done with build out, you know the data that's collected, but how do we establish the baseline you know when you get these data, what do you compare it to right?\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): Yea that’s what we’re trying to figure out yeah\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Organization, 0): Because they don’t think we have a database to compare it to\n","A0 (Assertive, Explain, Organization, 0): They probably do. I mean we just didn’t they they probably didn't have time to share with us.\n","A0 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): It looks like a V7 (from Company Z) was trying to tell us more and because we're running out of time we didn't even see any videos. Which I know I’d like to see more.\n","L0 (Commissive, Negotiate, Process, 0): Okay, all right, so I will set up a follow up meeting in two weeks..\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): yeah\n","L0 (Commissive, Negotiate, Process, 0): but i'll send a V8 you know V8 uh an email,\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): mmhmm\n","L0 (Commissive, Negotiate, Process, 0): saying that the yeah you know, please answer all these questions and,\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): sure\n","L0 (Commissive, Negotiate, Process, 0): In addition, would like to have a deeper discussion on your machine learning and you know, so that we understand how the analytics is performed\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): yeah\n","L0 (Commissive, Negotiate, Process, 0): behind the scene right? So\n","A1 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Product, 1): And it should be specific to Software B right? I think they have..\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): mmhmm\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): the other metrics. That one I think it's a separate product, uh separate project as well\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): um, but we can easily- he showed how to transfer data to it,\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): we have all that set up so\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): We could do that at no cost\n","A0 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): Exactly, exactly. This is specific to Software B. How do we, so we need, when we compare with Company R right at minimum Software B should be able to tell us when there's a bearing failure, lubrication issues, the belt is getting loose, you know all this [big] information should be there. Um.. um.. um..\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): yeah you know, so I don't know how Company R Company R does it with the vibration sensor they have. Do they compared to a template saying you know these kind of anomalies, anomalies is mostly likely appearing\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): yeah\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): and this kind is going to be you know whatever right. \n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): Yes. yeah we, they have they have a baseline, so we- so the and then we also- so we take that baseline and we built that analytics in Software A.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): Yeah, yeah. \n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): So yeah so the the the recommendation to lubricate the bearing or to.. faulty bearing all that is done in Software A. It's not an Company R thing\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): exactly\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): it's something Company K, which again\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): yea\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): have been great service, they have helped us build this in Software A.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): yeah they have tons of knowledge right, by looking at the trends they immediately can tell oh this is the issue, or translate that knowledge in Software A.\n","L0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Organization, 0): So so we want the same thing from Company Z.\n","A0 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Organization, 0): Oh yeah yeah.\n","L0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Organization, 0): See if they have it.\n","A0 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Organization, 0): Yeah\n","L0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): What happen if there answer is say, \"no we don’t, we got to, we got to take your baseline and build on it”\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): So it's not really- the baseline is- it's just alarm limits.\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0):  It's not really that complicated we we kind of see where the fan is and then we set alarm limits on the different frequency bands\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): mmhmm\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): and then the recommendation is based on if we see high vibration on low frequency band, it might be lubrication. If we see high vibration on a high frequency band, it might be a faulty bearing\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): yep\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): So it's that logic, we have built into Software A.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): It sounds like from V7, he he he actually share with us some of the parameters which are also available in Company R's solution. So sounds like their their vibration sensors are kind of similar to what we have here.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Okay\n","A0 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): But what was the uh you know, how do they use that data to come up with a recommendation\n","L0 (Directive, Decide, Process, 0): Okay, all right so definitely push for a follow up meeting\n","A0 (Commissive, Decide, Process, 0): yeah\n","L0 (Directive, Decide, Process, 0): and we want to pursue the pilot.\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Product, 0): And A0, you said you know for the pilots 500 bucks for five sensors.\n","A0 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): They said something about a pack of five sensors right?\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Okay\n","A1 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): And you, you can actually. Um. I don't know, let me just share my screen.\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): Um. [mumbling] You cannot share screen, oh! [Prior screen share ends]\n","A1 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): let me share. [A1 shares screen navigates browser to Company Z Software B site > Pricing ]\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): So yeah five senses and one wireless gateway $715\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): Okay.\n","NA (NA, NA, NA, 0): [silence, while scrolling screen]\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): And the integration of the gateway to Software A is all wireless right? so it just IP address and you link up\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): Uhh. So the- yeah basically you take your phone and you say this sensor should go to this gateway\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Ah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): and then the gateway will send it to Company Z, and then Company Z well yeah it's available in s3 where we can pick it up from Software A. So it will go to their system where they will- so they will take all the data they will do different models on it and predict if something is wrong and they will set a baseline and all that stuff and then they will export the raw data and the predictions they have done uh to Software A.\n","NA (NA, NA, NA, 0): [silence]\n","L0 (Directive, Negotiate, Organization, 0): So A0 you have money to uh to fund these $715.\n","A0 (Assertive, Evaluate, Product, 0): that's that's nothing.\n","L0 (Assertive, Evaluate, Product, 0): Yeah that’s nothing, [laughs]\n","L0 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): put it on your credit card.\n","A1 (NA, NA, NA, 0): But I, I guess…\n","A0 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): Yeah you can, you can do it too I mean you put it in\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): and I don't think it has to go to anybody for approval, you can maybe approve it yourself.\n","A1 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): That, I think that the missing piece here is the installation right?\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Organization, 0): They expect us to install it.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, NA, 0): that's a question yeah that's the question.\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): yeah they say put some- just glue it on\n","A0 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): yeah I mean, how do we know is installed correctly. So that’s…\n","L0 (Assertive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): Well machine learning will figure it out, right?

So this learning from data. Looks like. Anyways let me stop sharing. [screen share ends]\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): So how is failure mode defined in their data?\n","NA (NA, NA, NA, 0): [silence]\n","A1 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): Failure mode?\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): Yea, failure mode, you know, .. root cause.\n","A1 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): Oh, I think that's the- you put in if if something happens and it doesn't know what it asks you what it is, and then you tell it and then it's kind of collective intelligence right?\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): all the people in the world with fans they tell it what it is, and then it learns what it is, so the longer, and the more people who use it, the smarter it gets.\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): yeah and you know does Company Z have that database? You know does our failure [someone shares screen of Software A] mode get shared with the rest of the world?\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, NA, 0): you know um because you know just those kind of questions. I don’t know. Um yea.\n","A1 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): If it's used to train the model it's not really being shared with anyone right?\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): It’s just, it just gets smarter.\n","L0 (Directive, Explain, Process, 0): yeah. Then then from those uh, from those data somebody still has to go look at it say that's mostly caused by bearing, that's mostly caused by lubricant. you know uh. So how do we, how do we get that information into the machine learning right?\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): Oh it's. It- So machine learning works the way, something happened to tell it what it is, you label this is as faulting bearing; something else happens you you label it, this is this, and then the more examples you give it.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): When you have a specific error, the, the smarter it gets and the better it gets at detecting that. So no human is ever going to look at the data. It’s just being fed into a model that is constantly being trained.\n","L0 (Directive, Explain, Process, 0): yeah yeah. so so to start a model a human still have to teach the machine\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): mmhmm\n","L0 (Directive, Explain, Process, 0): How to, how to look at the data right? you know.\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): Well yeah yeah that’s the- I think that's the screenshot I showed where if something happens\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): and it doesn't know what it is you tell it this is\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): a misalignment caused by wear\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): and the action is to replace.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): And then the next time it, you know it gets better at that and then\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Yep\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Yeah\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): Yeah. So, so in the very beginning, you, you get you say the equipment is good, this is the, this is the baseline, this is the vibration you're supposed to see, and then, when there's an alarm that comes up the machine say what is this right?\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): Yes\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): And I I have to get a technician out there, go look at the machine, say “oh yeah, it’s ah it’s lubricant, I need to add lubricant.” Okay, so you feed that information back to the machine, say this is caused by lubricant right?\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): mmhmm\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): and then you gotta do it over and over and over again until the machine’s smart enough, that you know it, it can say okay that's lubricant you know, that’s bearing. Right? Ah and then you got to do it for each piece of equipment or each category of equipment right? if I do pumps right? does zero to 10 horsepower pump, you know, have the same pattern? When I get up to 50 horsepower pump you know that pattern is going to look different right? so all that information will be continuously fed into the uh, the data so that the machine learning can accumulate it, you know collecting all those root cause anomaly and correlate you know, for future reference right?\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Organization, 0): Mhmm. And I think that's exactly why there's only a few companies in the world who can do this: Company Z, Company M, Company N. That's the only companies that it's big enough to get enough sample data.\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): As I think he said it's less than a year old this product, and they have more than 1000 customers, so far, I think he said.\n","A1 (Directive, Explain, Process, 0): So it's yeah, it is definitely collective intelligence right?\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): yeah.\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): All the different sites tells what what it is when something goes wrong, and then it learns and learns and gets smarter and smarter.\n","L0 (Directive, Explain, Process, 0): yeah yeah. And it’s a living, it’s a living process because you come and get you know, uh uh produce differently so you have different patterns so every time you have a new piece of equipment you got to start over again. Right? And this process repeats you know over the life of the project, the equipment, you know and the maintenance, you know uh strategy on you know pieces of equipment right? so. yeah I mean this takes some discipline and continuously mainten- maintenance right? it's not something you you you set it up, then you walk away right? You got to kind of monitor it and continuously make it, make it more intelligent right so.\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): yeah but it's still- it's not just us.\n","A1 (Directive, Explain, Process, 0): So you don’t, and the reason why only big companies can do it, because how often do you have a bearing failure right?\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): that's maybe, out of our building maybe once or twice a year.\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): it and you need millions of samples that's why they take millions of samples from millions of air handlers. And then train the model\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): so if we don't do anything, it will still get smarter, because all the other sites in the world using this is feeding input.\n","L0 (Directive, Evaluate, Organization, 0): yeah so A1 you just mentioned a good point right? so say a certain fan manufacturer has you know uh 10, say 20 models right? And then the 20 models send out over the last 10 years to hundreds of customer right? so each one of these customer do their own maintenance right?\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): mmhmm\n","L0 (Directive, Evaluate, NA, 0): And a lot of them don't use CBM they use their you know every three months I gotta go lubricate that anyway. I don't collect any data right? so the only data, you can collect at the company that sign up to do this right?\n","L0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): So that's, the question we need to ask Company Z say how many company and how many equipment and what’s the model of equipment? Are those data applicable to us? you know, do we want to share our data into this pool of you know, data that they're collecting to make the model smarter for everybody, not just Company A right? so.\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): yeah and I. yeah I don't see why not we wouldn't share it. I mean we get a, we get a more reliable system at a fraction of the cost.\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Organization, 0): Company Z they kind of, they don't want to sell devices right? they not a hardware company. they want to sell cloud compute. so we’re, we're using their compute cluster to compute and predict all these things.\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Organization, 0): So I think everyone is, in my opinion, everyone is a winner. And the fact are I think,\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): A0 is now showing the formulas well that's something else but. We..\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): The formula\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): No the the formula we currently have for vibration it's the same for every single piece of equipment. So\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): Oh yeah, yeah.\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Product, 0): when it high high, high high um, high frequency vibration versus low frequency it doesn't matter we use it for all the air handlers, different make model. so I don't think it needs to be that specific, a specific model for each piece of equipment per se.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): yeah like this one, right here. [shows screen with Software A system explorer and some formulas and what they mean or what action they trigger]\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah.\n","A0 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): Pick few alarms\n","A1 (NA, NA, Process, 0): So we’ll look at.. \n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): For example, this one. [uses mouse to point at one of the triggers and formulas, aka alarms]\n","A1 (NA, NA, Product, 0): The velocity monitor that's the one.. Isn’t that one we..?\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): Velocity monitor that's the one that uh… [clicks on velocity monitor brings up new screen]\n","A1 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): Oh, and then, if you go to the bottom. Scroll down on the, formulas.\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Process, 0): There you go\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): Yeah, we can see if we have a overall vibration high alarm and high band alarm is high, then it’s bearing fault. If we have a overall high alarm and a mid band alarm and a high alarm then it's probably a lubricate bearing. So, the logic, we have today is not specific to the equipment. The alarm limits are specific to the equipment, how much it vibrates but if that of course is different, based on how it's mounted and stuff right but, besides the alarm limits it's the same formulas we use on everything.\n","L0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): Yeah um, those are the kind of questions we want to confirm with Company Z. You know, and sometimes, sometimes, um you know, we might even have to go back to the equipment manufacturer to um to ask them, you know, to provide some insight on some of the anomalies right?\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): Um so. Just just you know I can see, I can see that you know this supposed to be a win win situation for everyone, but uh, you know this is not the first time that this kind of initiative was initiated in the industry.\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Organization, 0): Actually you know the Agency A, you know, was trying to do this for many, many years. But end up that the Agency A and the Agency B, you know they weren't able to maintain this data.\n","L0 (Directive, Describe, Process, 0): They did it for like 10, 15 years and they find out, you know, without a computer you know human doing it humanly is almost impossible because of the type of the equipment. The type of data they're collecting and so on, so forth right?\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): so yeah i'm really curious about how Company Z approach these you know.\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): yeah um me too.\n","A1 (Directive, Explain, Product, 0): I think it is because it's it's when it's neural networks, I think I read somewhere, they need millions of samples before they get accurate right?\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Organization, 0): and no company in the world can can have 1 million faulty bearings. So you really need a big company like Company Z to kind of gather this data for thousands of, from thousands of sites, to train this model. So it's definitely interesting to see how well it works.\n","L0 (Directive, Explain, Organization, 0): yeah you know if Company Z can do that they're hitting a you know, a big black hole in the industry that everybody wanted, you know, because really helped the industry right? But I don't know how successful they are in terms of you know, initiating these and be able to you know sort out the data, analyze the data, and share the results with you know not just people that sign up for Software B right?\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): you know even feedback to the manufacturer say you know what your your piece of equipment show these failure, you know every five years, maybe you can improve the product, you know. And you know so anyway.\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Product, 0): yeah to me it's the disruption is the price.\n","A1 (Directive, Explain, Product, 1): That that's what really sets it apart right?\n","L0 (Assertive, Explain, Product, 0): yeah, yea\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): We can buy two sensors for the same price as a battery for the current sensor. Almost three sensors for the price of the battery.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah.\n","L0 (Directive, Negotiate, Process, 0): Okay, so A0 you want to show us.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Process, 0): [changes screen to Software A for AHU] yeah so after we discuss last week, I make some changes on the on the formula here.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): so I break it down to two top- to two calculations for each tunnel.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): Okay\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): so this tunnel A, tunnel B. [we can see the equation he is talking about on screen]\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): so I- the power can- power can. I took the the running average for the past two weeks for the power consumption.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): and then divide by the bi-weekly as well, the filter DPs.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yea\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): the final and pre divided by this this point two.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): Yea the formula right.\n","A0 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): that's the good dp values right?\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): yeah\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): and do the power of 1.5\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): Um. Then I do the kW difference.\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah.\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Oh\n","L0 (Assertive, NA, NA, 0): Okay.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): The energy costs is the, also the run, using the runtime for the past two weeks.\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): yep yep.\n","NA (NA, NA, NA, 0): [silence]\n","A1 (NA, NA, NA, 0): Where do we.\n","A0 (NA, NA, NA, 0): Go\n","A1 (Directive, Describe, Product, 1): So we take the average kilowatt, but where do we multiply it by the number of hours in the two weeks?\n","A0 (Directive, Describe, Product, 0): Oh right here right? [points with mouse]\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): right here.\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): One time oh okay yeah okay that makes sense\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah\n","A0 (Assertive, NA, Product, 0): yeah\n","A1 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): perfect\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): So this tunnel A [points with mouse], Tunnel B. And then for the office is um [changes the screen to office calculation] very similar calculation, but it’s um it's yeah just one, yeah\n","L0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): yeah it just one fan system.\n","A0 (Assertive, Describe, Product, 0): yeah exactly yeah.\n","A1 (Assertive, Explain, Process, 0): I think we actually need to change the formula a little bit.

And then when when you know we change several pre filter and we find out that this limit is still high that tells us that we need to go change out the final filter [A0 shares screen with Software A and a BMS like screen of AHU]. so i'm thinking that's probably a good compromise, without having to actually go change out the sensor because he said there's just not enough physical space to do that. yeah yeah A0 you showing that?\n","A0 (Directive, Formulate Alternative, Process, 0): So you want this combined and we look at it as a whole.

Oh, by the way this is, [still sharing screen and scrolling down Company Z Software B page with images of a phone app that includes failure mode, failure cause, action taken fill-ins] kind of with the machine learning right it- what we talked about failure mode, so you if there's an error exists that it doesn't know you kind of gave it the reason and it learns from that. So this learning from data. Looks like. Anyways let me stop sharing. [screen share ends] So how is failure mode defined in their data? [silence] Failure mode? Yea, failure mode, you know, .. root cause. Oh, I think that's the- you put in if if something happens and it doesn't know what it asks you what it is, and then you tell it and then it's kind of collective intelligence right? all the people in the world with fans they tell it what it is, and then it learns what it is, so the longer, and the more people who use it, the smarter it gets. yeah and you know does Company Z have that database? You know does our failure [someone shares screen of Software A] mode get shared with the rest of the world? you know um because you know just those kind of questions. I don’t know. Um yea. If it's used to train the model it's not really being shared with anyone right? It’s just, it just gets smarter. yeah.

I think it is because it's it's when it's neural networks, I think I read somewhere, they need millions of samples before they get accurate right? and no company in the world can can have 1 million faulty bearings. So you really need a big company like Company Z to kind of gather this data for thousands of, from thousands of sites, to train this model.
